  <h1> F.A.Q.</h1> <br>
  <p> Here we've put together answers to the questions that most baffle our
    perspective and outgoing applicants! If your question isn't answered here,
    then please feel free to drop by our office or get in touch with us by phone,
    email or on our Twitter (@campcanadaeh) and Facebook. </p> <br>

    <div id="q1"> Why should i go through camp canada? </div>
      <div id="a1"> Making arrangements to work at a camp is challenging.
        The visa can be confusing, it is difficult to find camps that are
        willing to hire international staff and it is challenging to determine
        which camps will provide the necessary support and benefits to help you
        succeed at camp. Camp Canada will provide you with a face-to-face
        interview and a pre-arranged camp placement, which we think will suit
        your skills, personality and what you hope to get out of your summer
        adventure! In addition, our partner company, NYQUEST, will help you
        get settled in Canada and provide support and emergency assistance
         during your work placement. </div>


    <div id="q2"> When should i apply for the programme? </div>
    <div id="a2">Now! We take applications up until March, but Camp places fill
       up quickly and applying early gives you the maximum choice of camps with
       which we work.</div>


    <div id="q3"> How long is the placement and when do i have to be available
    for? </div>
    <div id="a3"> Placements are 9-10 weeks long and you must be available on
    the 25th of June. </div>


    <div id="q6"> How do i get started? </div>
    <div id="a6"> To get started is very easy, just fill out our online
      application form. We will then review it and then get in contact with you
      very soon after. </div>

    <div id="q7"> How do i get paid? </div>
    <div id="a7"> As soon as you get into Canada you will be set up with a
      Canadian bank account. Your camp will pay your wages into this bank account. </div>

    <div id="q8"> Will i get free time? </div>
    <div id="a8"> Yes, you will definitely get free time. It is important to
      remember that you are there to work and you will work hard. Typically
      staff members get at least six days off during the eight week camp session
       and some free time every day.</div>

      <div id="q9"> How old do i have to be?</div>
     <div id="a9"> You must be 19 by the 1st June. We do accept some 18 year
     olds but the must have exceptional skills and experience with children. </div>

     <div id="q10"> How much does it cost? </div>
     <div id="a10"> The total programme cost is £249 split into two payments to
       make it easier for you(&pound;50 and &pound;249). There are also third party costs
       involved, which are flights (about £450-600 depending), CRB (£60), and
       Visa (&#x24;150 CAD). </div>
