  <p> All of our staff members have experienced how awesome camp is, whilst
    working in roles such as arts and crafts, horse riding instructors, swimming
     teachers, sports coaches and girl scout leaders amongst many many other
     roles and we're always happy to answer any questions that you may have -
     with our huge Summer camp Canada experience, we're confident that there
     isn't a problem that we won't be able to solve! If you're not sure what
     role you could do at a camp in Canada then we can help with this too.
     There really is a role for everyone!
<br> <br>
When we're not sipping on tea and eating #FreeBiscuits thinking how to make your
 experience at camp as magical as possible, we're picking up amazing awards for
 our hard-work; Save The Student have crowned us Best Summer Camp Organisation
 six years running!
<br> <br>
The AmeriCamp Canada application process doesn't take too long and with all our
 help it's as easy as eating one of our legendary #FreeBiscuits and for a summer
  of a lifetime believe us when we say it's worth every minute.</p>
