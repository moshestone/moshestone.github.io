<h1>Programmes </h1>
<p> The Application Process <br> <br>There are three positions you can apply for
  at a Camp in Canada. They are general camp counselor, activities camp
  counselor and support staff. While the counselor positions are the most
  popular and have you working closely with the children, all positions need
  you to be highly energetic and outgoing. Theses positions are great
  opportunities to boost your skills, add international work to your CV and
  to immerse yourself in the Canadian culture. </p>

  <h3>Orientation</h3>
  <!-- <p>You will attend an orientation in the U.K.</p> -->

<p>  Once you arrive in the host city of the province you will be working in,
  you will attend an orientation. During this time you will meet other
  international staff, get free tours of the city and free accommodation, open
  your Canadian bank account and apply for your Social Insurance Number. The
  camps will then come and pick you up from this location saving you the
  hassle of finding your way to camp. </p>
